# Supply Chain Management Using Qlik Insight

## Introduction

This project, "Data-Driven Innovations in Supply Chain Management with Qlik Insights," leverages supply chain data to derive valuable insights and support decision-making for manufacturers, distributors, and related stakeholders. By utilizing Qlik's powerful analytical and visualization capabilities, we uncover patterns, trends, and correlations within supply chain data to address key business challenges.

1. Inventory Optimization: Analyzing historical inventory levels to identify optimal stock levels and reduce holding costs.
2. Supplier Performance Management: Enhancing supplier relationships by identifying performance trends and areas for improvement.
3. Operational Efficiency: Improving logistics and transportation efficiency by predicting peak demand periods and optimizing routes.
4. Customer Satisfaction: Enhancing customer satisfaction by understanding and responding to demand variability and supply chain disruptions.
